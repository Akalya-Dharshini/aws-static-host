🚀 Configured an S3 Bucket with a Public Access Policy! 🌩️

I recently set up an Amazon S3 bucket for static website hosting and configured a bucket policy to allow public read access. This enables seamless content delivery without a web server!

✅ S3 Static Website Hosting Enabled
✅ Bucket Policy Configured for Public Read Access
✅ Secure and Scalable Storage Solution

Excited to explore more AWS services for optimization! 🎯
